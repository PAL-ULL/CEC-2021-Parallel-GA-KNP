### Abstract:
Deciding which optimisation technique to use for solving a particular optimisation problem is an important and
ardour task that has been faced in the field of optimisation for decades. The above problem is known as the Algorithm
Selection Problem (ASP), which was firstly proposed by Rice in
1976. In the last decades, many researchers have tried to solve
the ASP for a wide variety of problems, from combinatorial
to global optimisation. The optimisation techniques considered
in previous works are mainly, optimisation techniques which
can be executed in a fast manner or datasets of previously
solve instances with several algorithms. However, considering
more sophisticated optimisation approaches for solving the ASP,
such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), drastically increases the
computational cost involved. For that reason, we are interested
in solving the ASP by considering different configurations of
a Genetic Algorithm (GA) applied to the well-known NP-hard
0/1 Knapsack Problem (KP). The above involves the execution
of a significant number of configurations of the said GA in
order to evaluate their performance when applied to a wide
range of instances with different features of the KP, which is a
computationally expensive task. Therefore, the main aim of the
current work is to provide an efficient parallel GA, which is able
to attain competitive results, in terms of the optimal objective
value, in a short amount of time. Computational results show
that our approach is able to scale efficiently and considerably
reduces the average elapsed time for solving KP instances
